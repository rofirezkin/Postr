## App Description 
This application has several features that can be used by users, including automatically creating a random user when entering the application, posting text, viewing user posts, and replying posts. The application uses local storage to store feed data when the user does not have an internet connection. The libraries used in this application are react-navigation for screen transitions, async-storage for local storage, react-netinfo for checking the network connection, i18n-js for language localization, and flash-message for displaying messages to the user. For the UI, I used pure React Native to enhance React Native skills. In addition, This application is compatible with iOS and Android and implemented useContext for global state management.
